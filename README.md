# Move Firefox Bookmarks To Folders

A Firefox addon for automatically moving bookmarks to folders. 

## Goals

I use Firefox bookmarks a lot. At the time of this writing I have around 50,000 of them. :smiley: Since almost all of them are in one folder, managing them tends to slow down Firefox quite a bit. I've found that bookmarks that are in folders with fewer items in them don't have this slow down problem.

The primary goal of this addon is to move bookmarks in bulk to different folders, with a set number of bookmarks in each. The secondary goal is to have this be done automatically after each new bookmark is added.
