# Instructions

1.   Write changes to the project under *Unreleased*.
2.   When it's time for release, move them under a heading with the version number and date of the next release.
3.   *Unreleased* and the version numbers are linked. Change their targets to the appropriate values for your project. The initial release should have the target `<first commit>...<first version>`, for example `1234...v0.1.0`. The link for unreleased should have the target `<latest version>...HEAD`, for example `v0.1.0...HEAD`.
